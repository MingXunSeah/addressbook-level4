== PROJECT: RecruitBook

---

== Overview

RecruitBook is a project created for CS2113T, Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering, in the first semester of the second year of my undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore. It was created with reference from https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/[SE-EDU's AddressBook 4] in a group of 5 using GitHub as our collaboration medium.

The project involved turning the AddressBook application into RecruitBook, an application which aids Job Agents find suitable candidates for companies and vice versa.
My role in this project was to develop the email feature.

Apart from simply developing the software, I have picked up many hard skills from working on this project such as using proper coding standards, using continuous integrations, writing tests, using JavaFX, and many software engineering principles
such as the Law of Demeter and Brooks' Law.

I have also picked up soft skills while working with my team such as using the "I message" to get my points across without sounding rude,
meeting skills to include everybody in the discussion so as to get everybody's input to prevent future misunderstandings,
and when conflicts arise, conflict resolution skills where I have to be careful in my choice of words
so as to solve the conflict professionally, while mitigating damage where possible.

RecruitBook is a desktop application created for job agents. The user interacts with it using a command line interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10,000 lines of code. +


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added an email feature
** What it does: Allows the user to mass send emails about job offers to multiple candidates or about candidates to multiple companies regarding specified job offers.
** Justification: It is imperative for a job agent to be able to inform candidates about job offers or inform companies about candidates. This feature allows emails to be sent quickly and automatically without any hassles.
** Highlights: The email will be automatically generated, all the user needs to do is select the recipients and contents of the email. There is a preview feature built into the command to allow the user to double check the recipients and contents of the email. Subject text and body text of the email is also customisable.

== PROJECT: PartyCards

---

== Overview

PartyCards was a project created for CP2106, Independent Software Development Project (Orbital), during the summer after my first year in the National University of Singapore.
The project was created from scratch in a group of 2, using GitHub as our collaboration medium.

PartyCards was written with ReactJS frontend and Node.js backend. Being forced to write this web application from scratch gave me many insights into the world of website creation, from creating the back-end server to the front-end design of the website. I also learnt how to use the ReactJS javascript framework and use NodeJS effectively as the back end for the website, which is the preferred choice of frameworks to use for website-building nowadays.

PartyCards is a web application that allows up to 4 users play card games. Card games include: Cheat, Taiti, Bridge and Hearts.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added game: Cheat
** What it does: Allows up to 4 users to connect and play the game: Cheat.
** Highlights: I wrote the logic of the game, from how the front end checks if a card being played is valid to how the back end handles if somebody is being accused as cheating.

* *Major enhancement*: Added game: Taiti
** What it does: Allows up to 4 users to connect and play the game: Taiti.
** Highlights: I wrote the logic of the game, from how the front end checks if a card combination being played is valid to how back end handles each turn and updates the current deck.

* *Major enhancement*: Reconnection feature
** What it does: Allows users to disconnect from the game instance and rejoin the game instance,
** Justification: Users should be allowed to reconnect to a game should they disconnect due to bad internet connection.
** Highlight: When the user reconnects, all cards the user had will be reinstated, allowing the user to pick up where he/she left off.

* *Major enhancement*: Added mobile support to PartyCards
** What it does: Allows users to play PartyCards comfortably on a mobile screen.
** Justification: Websites should always support mobile(portrait) and desktop(landscape) orientations. This will make the web-application playable on all platforms.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `Milestone 1` - `Milestone 3` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Documentation:
*** Updated https://github.com/andrewome/PartyCards/blob/master/README.md[README.md] with documentation on PartyCards
** Tools:
*** Integrated Socket.io into the project to handle easy client to client communication
